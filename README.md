# diabetes-csv-analysis
this project required me to analyze and visualize the main causes of diabetes in PIMA Women in India and highlight the biggest determinats of diabetes
it includes different predictors and one dependent variable which is diabetes
the comments are indicated in the code itself and i feel like they are self explanatory
i used R studio for this project and if there are any questions please feel free to contact me on my github(LusuiAllan)
i'm open to any corrections and a report on the project is available
